0,What’s a completely harmless thing that irrationally annoys you?,"I’m talking small, stupid stuff that shouldn’t make you mad… but absolutely does.

For me? When someone starts telling me a story and then goes “oh nevermind.”

No. You don’t get to do that. I need closure now.

What’s yours?",:chat: Just Chatting,1742762846.0,17,18,1ji9bva,1.0,False
1,What are your thoughts on my ideal city?,"If I made a city from scratch, had all creative control with an unlimited budget:
I’d prioritize walkability and public transit, and try to incorporate more nature into cities.  I’d also try to plant Miyawaki (aka tiny forests) forests to boost the biodiversity in the area. I’d try to encourage musicians to play in public areas as well to create a nice ambiance.

Now getting into fun the part— I’d try to create distinct districts to create its own unique feel. Here are some themes for the districts:
-Pastel district, where the colors provide a nice pop
-A Deco district, because it’s a cool architectural style
-A cyberpunk district, where it feels like you’re in Blade Runner and everything feels futuristic. 

You can add to or nix any of these ideas",:thinking: Thoughts & Ideas,1742761209.0,5,8,1ji8oqu,1.0,False
2,What is a song that left y'all shocked with amazement after listening to it?,"I must give credit to this post for partially inspiring this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1jfxiip/what\_is\_everyones\_favorite\_go\_to\_song/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1jfxiip/what_is_everyones_favorite_go_to_song/)

So the other day, while I was wandering down the nature trail, I was looking for a song to listen to on my phone, and that's when I stumbled across a song by post-rock band Sigur Rós called ""Ný batterí."" Out of curiosity, I decided to listen to it and from the first note until the last, I was mind blown at how incredible this song was. Everything about this song (from the ambient vibe throughout the song, to Jónsi's breathtaking vocal performance, to the erupting crescendo near the end) brought my soul into a state of constant tranquility and euphoria. Definitely going to listen to more of their discography in the future!",:note: Music,1742758670.0,8,18,1ji7ox7,1.0,False
3,Tried to impress a girl but it backfired,"So there's this cute girl 'G', in my class and she sings, I'm really into music as well. We have sung together on certain occassions before but we're not really friends. Recently, an opportunity for a gig came up and she was part of our group. I play the guitar but never infront of her, i thought this'd be a chance to impress her.

We start practice and just trying out different songs, everyone was vibing. It was an open area so passing students would hang out for a while and give compliments. I would occasionally glance at G and she seemed oddly quiet, just smiling along. Anyway when we were done with the practice, a bunch of classmates came up to me - "" Yo OP that was sick. We had no idea you played the guitar- blah blah blah"". I was appreciative but honestly I was still looking at my crush, who again seemed cold.

Right after they left, she came up to me and took the guitar.

"" Oof this is a little heavy. How long did it take u to learn it?""

""Uhh around 2 months I guess. Haha""

""Oh must've been hard, huh?""

"" Yeah it takes a while to get the hang of it.""

"" I bet I can learn it faster tho.""

""Mm?""

"" Well, I'm a quick learner. I can already kinda play the ukulele so a guitar won't be that hard.""

"" Yeah you can definitely pick it up quicker. Practice was fun, right?""

"" Sure"" 

 she tries to strum the guitar for a good while then gives it back to me.
She then leaves after waving goodbye. I don't know what I did to make it so awkward.",:story: Life Stories,1742757689.0,10,12,1ji7atp,0.73,False
4,"I miss playing sports in HS, but I definitely enjoy being a spectator more.","I grew up as a multi-sport athlete, and while there are days when I miss being a player, there’s a lot of stuff that I simply don’t miss. A lot of it being because of the summer months with how busy my days could be. 

So I went out for Football (not soccer), Basketball, Golf, and Baseball. Which made my summers crazy busy. 

A normal summer day in the life of me would start at 5:00 in the morning, I would report to Strength and Conditioning workouts. After S&C was over, I would go have either open gym for basketball, or a basketball team camp, then I would have to turn around and play a baseball game. 

After about the first month of summer break, I would do S&C workouts, then I had to do either a light contact football camp *or* we had full contact camps, then I would turn around and have to throw 70+ pitches in a baseball game while battling soreness (ouch). 

Come time for the end of summer break, we would still do S&C, we’d have one more football camp, and still more baseball games! 

Our baseball schedule end of the season was wild, in order to get to state, you had to win a four team Districts tournament. Win that, and you move on to “Super Districts” where you played a three game series against just one team, THEN you move onto the State playoffs where it was an eight team double elimination bracket. Ugggh, we made it to the finals my senior year and we battled up from the loser’s bracket, so we had to play the finals twice before losing the second game lol. 

Finally S&C would end for the summer, we moved onto “two-a-days” for football practice. In the 90 degree August heat, and the worst humidity imaginable too. Something about it with the combination of the heat, the full contact two-a-day practices and just taking hits always made me tired and ready for a nap lol 

I honestly felt like I didn’t truly have a summer break for four years, I was always doing something. I miss playing sports but those summers were absolutely hectic, and it kinda makes me happy to be a spectator for the rest of my days lol. Oh I forgot to mention about basketball camps and open gym, the school shuts off their A/c during the summer… not fun lol",:chat: Just Chatting,1742756908.0,1,1,1ji6zsf,0.67,False
5,I saw two different albino animals on my jog this morning. It really made my day.,"I went for a jog through the woods this morning around sunrise. I live around 3,000 plus acres of state owned land. So I will jog about 3 miles of different trails a few times a week. 

I was going over a small bridge over a marsh and seen an albino River Otter on a log. It stood up, made a weird barking noise at me, and dove under the water. It made me extremely happy as River Otters have made a comeback in my state over the last 20 years. I'm glad that one is safe in the state park and hope I'll be lucky enough to see it again. 

On my way home as I was turning onto the county road towards my house, an albino Whitetail deer ran out in front of me. I couldn't believe it. Two albino animals in 1 day. It was such a magical experience. It's going to be a great day. 

What's the most unique or beautiful animal you have seen? I'm still blown away I got that lucky. ",:chat: Just Chatting,1742746355.0,5,1,1ji2tjv,1.0,False
6,I accidentally tasted the “good” rice,"I’m a broke final-year student barely scraping by, still two months away from my first full-time job, and my pantry reflects that reality. My go-to meal for the past year was 2kg bags of the cheapest white rice I can find. Nothing fancy. Just carbs and survival.

Anyway, I went to the store the other day, and surprise surprise—all the cheap rice was gone. Like, every brand under 1.50€ completely wiped out. The only thing left was some bougie-looking rice in a brown paper bag with a tiny window that says “hand-harvested” and “aged for aroma” (like it’s a bottle of wine or something??). It cost 2.79€, and I sighed while dropping it into my basket like it personally offended my wallet.

I just made it today with my usual cheap stir-fry veggies and soy sauce, and what the heck. It didn’t clump. It fluffed. Each grain was like... separate. It smelled good before I even added anything. The texture was perfect—not mushy, not too firm, just this glorious chewy balance. And even without sauce, it tasted like something. Like actual food. I could feel myself chewing slower just to appreciate it.

Now I can’t stop thinking about it. My mouth is having an identity crisis. What else have I been missing all this time?? Is this what not-poor people eat casually every day?

I hate it here.",:chat: Just Chatting,1742754612.0,1688,120,1ji62ya,0.98,False
7,What was the most bizarre nickname that you've ever had?,"People used to call me ""Veyron"" in high school because I was the fastest runner among all of us.
