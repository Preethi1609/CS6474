0,What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?,"The best parenting advice I have ever received was, ""They are not giving you a hard time, they are having a hard time.""  Its a constant reminder when I do feel like they are giving me a hard time, that I take a breath and figure out how I can be there for them.

2,Life finally hit,"34 Male

Not sure when it happens, but I think it will for everyone. Just now realizing that I can't do this thing called ""life"" alone, or without putting in extra work. My entire life has been easy, and when faced with some difficulties, like real struggle (3 months back on mortgage, verge of eviction, lost job, lost GF, picked up some bad drinking and smoking habits), I wana quit and take an easy route. But as I sit here alone, thinking and regretting and blaming other stuff besides myself, that is wrong thinking. Let this  maybe be a help to 1 person out there reading this....You really have to put the work in and try your best. Life is what you put it in, it really is. The world seems to be in a crazy place (through the eyes of a mid 30's American male), but at the end of the day, look out your window, look around you, and you can control all of that. So try your hardest, in everything you do, and then try even harder. Be kind to all, then pass on your good stuff to the youth. Good luck ",:general: Serious Discussion,1742703750.0,81,14,1jhr5w8,0.95,False
3,"If someone struggles with trust in a relationship, is it because they just haven't met the right person?","If someone has multiple relationships but always has difficulty with trust and feeling like they can't rely on their potential spouse, is this something deeper that needs to be fixed internally or have they just not met the right person?",:general: Serious Discussion,1742696905.0,6,14,1jhp704,0.67,False
4,Losing Hope,"I (21F) cheated on my ex boyfriend last year, after which we broke up. I feel like there were surely issues in our relationship but I was a coward to not end the relationship instead. I feel hopeless now, the poor guy is struggling with trust issues because of me.

I honestly wish him nothing but the best of luck, health and happiness and may he get the love he deserves. But sometimes, I just feel lonely and hopeless. Who would even love me knowing I cheated on that poor soul after he loved me so much? Sure, I'm trying to be a better person every day but hey, at the end of the day I'm a cheater. Will I ever find love? Should that even be on my mind after what I did? I'm lost.",:general: Serious Discussion,1742695326.0,0,43,1jhopu7,0.41,False
5,What is a traumatic event in your life that ultimately humbled you or turned you into a better person?,"For me, it was losing my eyesight at the age of 22. I’ll be 32 on the 30th of this month. When it first happened, I went to an extremely dark place. No pun intended… Lol. Seriously, though. It was bad. I thought about ending my own life a lot. I was pretty much in an extended manic depressive state. But after a while, I got used to it and Realized that I had two options: I could allow it to continue to drag me into the depths of misery, and basically live as an angry shell of a human being. Or I could let it make me stronger. I could take this bad thing and use it as fuel and motivation to work harder, try harder, push harder, etc.  yes, bad things happen to good people. But that doesn’t mean that you have to let it turn you into a bad person. It doesn’t mean that life is any less beautiful or worth living.    

So, what is something bad that happened to you that ultimately changed you as a human being, but in a good way? What did it teach you? And what ways did you grow from it? What did it teach you about the world in general? What did it teach you about yourself? If it were to happen to someone else, what advice would you give them?     

If you don’t feel comfortable sharing exactly what the bad thing was, that’s fine. You can still answer the rest of the questions though if you’d like. I’m just curious to see what valuable life lessons y’all have to share and how you used your own strength/resilience to get past obstacles.

6,"Do you think the problem with humanity is the Peter Principle--people continue to advance until they fail, and then stay at that final level of incompetence?","Some people argue that, in any hierarchy, competent people keep advancing until they finally get to a role where they're incompetent, because the skills required are different, and then they stay there at that plateau (and lack insight into their own incompetence).  This is called the Peter Principle.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter\_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)

What if, humanity just kept advancing until now we really can't handle where we're at, and that's why everything feels so dysfunctional?

Meaning, growth happened so fast in the last century that now we really don't know what's happening or what we're doing, and human cognition just can't keep up anymore?

We rely so much on hearsay now--we don't personally understand the science behind things, we don't really read the research behind it, we don't know who's biased and who's not, we don't know if we're being lied to or not--what do we \*actually\* know?  Yet we argue with others as if we know a lot.

When I was growing up, there weren't that many choices at the supermarket, at restaurants, on tv, etc.  Now there are infinite choices, so many that we just gave ourselves over to algorithms to show us what we want.

Have human circumstances evolved faster than the human brain?

Have we overwhelmed ourselves?  And what's the solution?",:general: Serious Discussion,1742687852.0,10,34,1jhmb95,0.92,False

8,Should completing a prison sentence wipe your slate clean?,"I heard this one girl say that is is unfair that when prisoners finish serving their time and are able to go back out into society, they are often still punished for the crime they did and they shouldn't be, because there are limitations as to what they can and cannot do in their day to day life because of their crime. I've always been quite a black and white person but her statement made me really think because I both disagree and agree with her, so I wanted someone else's input.

For example, if you are a pedophile and you rape a child, and you served your maximum sentence, once you get out of jail, should you want to be an elementary teacher, a youth baseball coach, or even have a child and take him to the children's museum, you wouldn't be able to do that. So ultimately, you're still being punished for your crime, even though you already did the time. Her stance is, since you *did* already do the crime, your slate should be wiped clean and you should be allowed to be a 3rd grade teacher if you wanted to or be a chaperone at your child's field trip.

I don't think it is okay to strip someone of their natural and constitutional rights for the remainder of their life because of a crime they committed, simply because I think it perpetuates systemic racism, classism, sexism, etc which leads to other significant issues, but I also feel like it's not that hard to *not* break the law, and people who do brought this on themselves, so whatever the consequences are, that's just what they have to endure. What are your thoughts? ",:general: Serious Discussion,1742669738.0,33,257,1jhfqp1,0.68,False
9,Should I cut off my friend of 8 years?,"So I've been friends with let's call her Sarah for over 8 years now, and I genuinely think she's a good person. The problem is, she NEVER texts me first and when I do, our conversations ale usually quick and shallow, me doing most of the talking, but when we're together irl she's great to talk to. 

She knows EVERYTHING about me, but I know absolutely nothing about her. (I didn't even know that she had a boyfriend for over a month untill recently I asked her myself, and having a boyfriend was something she really wanted for a long time so I hoped I'd be at least in the top five people to know about if first, but no)


She's always been a quiet type so I never questioned it, but over the years I really grew tired of it. Our plans never work out (she's always the one to cancel or ghosts me)  and a lot of times I genuinely feel like I'm annoying her.

When I see her with her other friends she just acts so.. different. And it hurts. Even in text, she's just so much more talkative to them and no matter what I do she's never like that with me and I feel like if I stopped texting first, out friendship would end.


But at the same time, I actually cut her off 2 years ago (I'm not gonna say details but her actions hurt me) and she actually tried to fix it? She apologised two times on two different social medias (I blocked her almost everywhere so she must've really dig deep to find out where I didn't block her and that means she cares) and and apologised very deeply. If she was annoyed by me she wouldn't do this, should she?


I want to mention that she's also deeply depressed and her parents are divorced so that was another reason why I think why she acts the way she does and I feel horrible for even thinking to cut her off, but always having to text first is just so draining.

 She means a lot to me, but no matter how many times I've asked her why she doesn't text me first she just brushes it off.

I don't want to loose her, but I also don't think I can do this for any longer. Why do I always have to be the one to do everything?",:general: Serious Discussion,1742669218.0,2,5,1jhfjo0,0.75,False
